  ## Description:
  For this project we had create a text editor and deploy it to Heroku. Not only did we have to deploy the application but 
  also have the notes that are taken in the app save even when offline. When the user deploys the app they are also given 
  an install option to install the applicaion icon to their desktop and be able to edit text offline. When the user goes 
  into inspecting the application they will see manifest.json along with indexedDB which saves and stores the text to the 
  database. That way even though the user exits out the text editor whatever information that was stored will reopen the 
  next time they open the app.
  
  ## Installation:
  For installation to use and navigate from localhost:
  
  1. Need to clone the repository.
  2. Navigate to the directory.
  3. Install dependencies needed by performing: npm install or npm i
  4. Run npm run build.
  5. Start the local host server by running npm start.

  For Heroku app:
  1. Click on the heroku link provided.
  2. Option 1: Use on web browser.
  3. Option 2: Insall app and use from application directly.
     
  ## Usage:
  The user has two options to use this app. Option1: through localhost or option2: through heroku application. Once the 
  user accesses the text editor application they can then install the application to their computer directly. This 
  application runs whether the user is offline or online. If the user is offline then it saves the text and then syncs when 
  the user goes back online.
